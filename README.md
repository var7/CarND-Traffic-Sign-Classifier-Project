Overview
---
In this project, I used what I learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. The dataset used is the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). For a detailed write up please have a look at the [writeup.md](https://github.com/var7/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup.md) file.
